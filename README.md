# Finding Models

This project was conducted in the context of the course unit "2nd Cycle Integrated Project in Applied Mathematics and Computation" from the Msc in Applied
Mathematics and Computation at IT Lisbon.
It was developed to explore solutions to the Minimal Hitting Set Problem in the context of Algebraic Machine Learning.

In the main file, "project_code.py" there are 7 main "chapters" in this code that are ordered in the following way:

   - (1)Creation/Import of different sets of atoms
   - (2)Generic functions to deal with the atoms and plot them
   - (3)Solution using Hitman package
   - (4)Solution using Staccato
   - (5)Functions to evaluate and plot the performance of the solutions
   - (6)Creation of dataframes with the sets of atoms, which are necessary to Staccato 
   - (7)Calls of the functions that plot the solutions obtained 


In the other file, "fullcrossing.py", it is implemented the algorithm with which the freest-model of the 2-by-2 example of squares with a black vertical bar is obtained. This script prints information along the training process so that it can be analysed to see how it works. A more detailed explanation of this example is available in the document "finding_models.pdf"
