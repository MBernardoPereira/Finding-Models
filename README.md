# IntegratedProjectIST

This Python script was developed in the context of the course "2nd Cycle Integrated Project in Applied Mathematics and Computation" from the Msc in Applied Mathematics and Computation at IST.
It was developed to explore solutions to the Minimal Hitting Set Problem in the context of Algebraic Machine Learning.

There are 7 main "chapters" in this code that are oredered in the following way:
    -Creation/Import of different sets of atoms
    -Generic functions to deal with the atoms and plot them
    -Solution using Hitman package
    -Solution using Staccato
    -Functions to evaluate and plot the performance of the solutions
    -Creation of dataframes with the sets of atoms, which are necessary to Staccato 
    -Calls of the functions that plot the solutions obtained
